# Substring

## Requirements

### C

*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
*   Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
*   All your files should end with a new line
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
*   You are not allowed to use global variables
*   No more than 5 functions per file
*   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
*   The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `substring.h`
*   Don't forget to push your header file
*   All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

### 0.

Write a function that finds all the possible substrings containing a list of words, within a given string.

*   Prototype: `int *find_substring(char const *s, char const **words, int nb_words, int *n);`, where:
    *   `s` is the string to scan
    *   `words` is the array of words all substrings must be a concatenation arrangement of
    *   `nb_words` is the number of elements in the array `words`
    *   `n` holds the address at which to store the number of elements in the returned array
*   Your function must return an allocated array, storing each index in `s`, at which a substring was found. If no solution is found, `NULL` can be returned
*   All words in the array `words` are the same length
*   A valid substring of `s` is the concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once and without any intervening characters
